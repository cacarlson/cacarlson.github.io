I am a ~3rd year PhD student studying [theoretical computer science at the University of Colorado Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/cs-theory/). My advisor is [Alexandra Kolla](http://home.cs.colorado.edu/~alko5368/). I got my MS (working with Alexandra) at the [University of Illinois Urbana Champaign](https://cs.illinois.edu/) and my bachelor's degrees at the [University of Alaska Fairbanks](https://www.cs.uaf.edu/). I have also spent a few semesters at the [Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing](https://simons.berkeley.edu/).

My __research interests__ include graph theory, algorithm design, complexity theory and combinatorial optimization. I am especially interested in using spectral techniques to solve graph problems.
